# arduino-input-to-array
Simple arduino code to load user inputs into an array.

Took a couple days to learn some of the ins and outs of arduino to help a friend troubleshoot a problem she was having with her simon-says personal project. The code simply stores the user's 5 most recent inputs into an array and outputs them to console.
